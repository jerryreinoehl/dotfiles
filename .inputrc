# Variables
#
# Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior. A variable may be set in the inputrc
# file with a statement of the form
#
#      set variable-name value
#
# Except where noted, readline variables can take the values On or Off (without regard to case). Unrecognized
# variable names are ignored. When a variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-insensitive),
# and "1" are equivalent to On. All other values are equivalent to Off. The variables and their default values
# are:

# bell-style (audible)
#      Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to none, readline never rings the
#      bell. If set to visible, readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If set to audible, readline attempts
#      to ring the terminal's bell.
# set bell-style visible
# set bell-style none

# bind-tty-special-chars (On)
#      If set to On (the default), readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by the kernel's
#      terminal driver to their readline equivalents.
# set bind-tty-special-chars Off

# blink-matching-paren (Off)
#      If set to On, readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis
#      is inserted.
set blink-matching-paren On

# colored-completion-prefix (Off)
#      If set to On, when listing completions, readline displays the common prefix of the set of possible completions
#      using a different color. The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
set colored-completion-prefix On

# colored-stats (Off)
#      If set to On, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type. The
#      color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
set colored-stats On

# comment-begin (``#'')
#      The string that is inserted in vi mode when the insert-comment command is executed. This command is bound to M-#
#      in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.
# set comment-begin //

# completion-display-width (-1)
#      The number of screen columns used to display possible matches when performing completion. The value is ignored
#      if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width. A value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed
#      one per line. The default value is -1.
# set completion-display-width 0

# completion-ignore-case (Off)
#      If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.
# set completion-ignore-case On

# completion-map-case (Off)
#      If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as
#      equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
# set completion-map-case On

# completion-prefix-display-length (0)
#      The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without
#      modification. When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an
#      ellipsis when displaying possible completions.
# set completion-prefix-display-length 10

# completion-query-items (100)
#      This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by the
#      possible-completions command. It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to zero. If the number of
#      possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he
#      wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal. A negative value causes readline to never
#      ask.
# set completion-query-items -1

# convert-meta (On)
#      If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the
#      eighth bit and prefixing it with an escape character (in effect, using escape as the meta prefix). The default
#      is On, but readline will set it to Off if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
# set convert-meta Off

# disable-completion (Off)
#      If set to On, readline will inhibit word completion. Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if
#      they had been mapped to self-insert.
# set disable-completion On

# echo-control-characters (On)
#      When set to On, on operating systems that indicate they support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to
#      a signal generated from the keyboard.
# set echo-control-characters Off

# editing-mode (emacs)
#      Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to Emacs or vi. editing-mode can be set to
#      either emacs or vi.
# set editing-mode vi

# emacs-mode-string (@)
#      If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the
#      primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active. The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set
#      of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the \1 and \2 escapes to begin
#      and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the
#      mode string.

# enable-bracketed-paste (Off)
#      When set to On, readline will configure the terminal in a way that will enable it to insert each paste into the
#      editing buffer as a single string of characters, instead of treating each character as if it had been read from
#      the keyboard. This can prevent pasted characters from being interpreted as editing commands.
# set enable-bracketed-paste On

# enable-keypad (Off)
#      When set to On, readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called. Some systems need this to
#      enable the arrow keys.
# set enable-keypad On

# enable-meta-key (On)
#      When set to On, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is
#      called. On many terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.
# set enable-meta-key Off

# expand-tilde (Off)
#      If set to On, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion.
# set expand-tilde On

# history-preserve-point (Off)
#      If set to On, the history code attempts to place point at the same location on each history line retrieved with
#      previous-history or next-history.
# set history-preserve-point On

# history-size (unset)
#      Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list. If set to zero, any existing history
#      entries are deleted and no new entries are saved. If set to a value less than zero, the number of history
#      entries is not limited. By default, the number of history entries is not limited. If an attempt is made to set
#      history-size to a non-numeric value, the maximum number of history entries will be set to 500.
# set history-size 1000

# horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)
#      When set to On, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single
#      screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line.
# set horizontal-scroll-mode On

# input-meta (Off)
#      If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not clear the eighth bit in the characters
#      it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support. The name meta-flag is a synonym for this
#      variable. The default is Off, but readline will set it to On if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
# set input-meta On

# isearch-terminators (``C-[ C-J'')
#      The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing the
#      character as a command. If this variable has not been given a value, the characters ESC and C-J will terminate
#      an incremental search.

# keymap (emacs)
#      Set the current readline keymap. The set of legal keymap names is emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx,
#      vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command; emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.
#      The default value is emacs. The value of editing-mode also affects the default keymap.
# set keymap vi

# keyseq-timeout (500)
#      Specifies the duration readline will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can
#      form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take additional input to complete a longer key
#      sequence). If no input is received within the timeout, readline will use the shorter but complete key sequence.
#      The value is specified in milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that readline will wait one second for
#      additional input. If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value,
#      readline will wait until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.
# set keyseq-timeout -1

# mark-directories (On)
#      If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
# set mark-directories Off

# mark-modified-lines (Off)
#      If set to On, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (*).
# set mark-modified-lines On

# mark-symlinked-directories (Off)
#      If set to On, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the
#      value of mark-directories).
# set mark-symlinked-directories On

# match-hidden-files (On)
#      This variable, when set to On, causes readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when
#      performing filename completion. If set to Off, the leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to
#      be completed.
# set match-hidden-files Off

# menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)
#      If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be
#      empty) before cycling through the list.
set menu-complete-display-prefix On

# output-meta (Off)
#      If set to On, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed
#      escape sequence. The default is Off, but readline will set it to On if the locale contains eight-bit characters.
# set output-meta On

# page-completions (On)
#      If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like pager to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.
# set page-completions Off

# print-completions-horizontally (Off)
#      If set to On, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather
#      than down the screen.
# set print-completions-horizontally On

# revert-all-at-newline (Off)
#      If set to On, readline will undo all changes to history lines before returning when accept-line is executed. By
#      default, history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across calls to readline.
# set revert-all-at-newline On

# show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)
#      This alters the default behavior of the completion functions. If set to On, words which have more than one
#      possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
# set show-all-if-ambiguous On

# show-all-if-unmodified (Off)
#      This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous. If
#      set to On, words which have more than one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the
#      possible completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing
#      the bell.
set show-all-if-unmodified On

# show-mode-in-prompt (Off)
#      If set to On, add a string to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi
#      insertion. The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., emacs-mode-string).
# set show-mode-in-prompt On

# skip-completed-text (Off)
#      If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line. It's only
#      active when performing completion in the middle of a word. If enabled, readline does not insert characters from
#      the completion that match characters after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following
#      the cursor are not duplicated.
# set skip-completed-text On

# vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))
#      If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the
#      primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode. The value is expanded like a key binding, so
#      the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the \1 and \2
#      escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control
#      sequence into the mode string.
# set vi-cmd-mode-string \1\e[2 q\2

# vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))
#      If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the
#      primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode. The value is expanded like a key binding,
#      so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available. Use the \1 and \2
#      escapes to begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control
#      sequence into the mode string.
# set vi-ins-mode-string \1\e[6 q\2

# visible-stats (Off)
#      If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is appended to the filename when listing
#      possible completions.
set visible-stats On
